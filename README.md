# V-LARA Airspace Data

This repository contains airspace data for the V-LARA system.

If you'd like to add a new FIR (Cluster), please follow the steps below.

---

## üìÅ Create the two files for your FIR

You will need to create **two files** named after your FIR (replace `xxxx` with the FIR name in **lowercase**):

1. `xxxx.geojson` ‚Äì for airspace geometry
2. `xxxx.json` ‚Äì for FIR configuration

---

## üåç Add `.geojson` File (`xxxx.geojson`)

This file should follow the GeoJSON format and define each airspace volume as a `Feature`.

### üîÅ TopSky Converter Tool

- You can easily convert TopSkyAreas.txt files into V-LARA GeoJSON format using the [Converter Tool](https://lara.lusep.fi/#/converter)
- After converting, please check the file manually. Only reservable areas shall be included!
- You can check the validity of the V-LARA GeoJSON file using the [Data Quality Tool](https://lara.lusep.fi/#/dqt)

### ‚úÖ Required GeoJSON Properties

Each `Feature` must contain the following fields inside its `properties` object:

| Field                 | Type   | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| `name`                | string | airspace name (e.g., `"TSA1"`). The airspace must match with the name in TopSky areas.txt!  |
| `type`                | string | Type of airspace (e.g., `"TSA"`, `"Local TRA"`). Keep the type as short as possible.        |
| `lowerFL`             | number | Lower flight level (e.g., SFC ‚Üí `0`. 500FT ‚Üí `5`. 9500FT ‚Üí `95`)                         |
| `upperFL`             | number | Upper flight level (e.g., 10700 FT ‚Üí `107`. UNL ‚Üí `999`)                                  |
| (`mustBeBookedWith`)  | array  | Optional list of airspace names that must be booked together or prior (e.g., `["TSA1", "TSA2"]`) |
| (`activationLimits`)  | array  | Optional list of time + month + weekday limitations (see example json above) |
| (`foreignClusters`)   | array  | Optional list of fir codes in lower case (e.g., `["efin"]`) - check information below! |

Make sure that:
- Each airspace has a **distinct `name`** and it shall **match with TopSky areas.txt**.
- Note! If you leave the name empty `"name": ""`, the shape will be visible on the map but not as a reservable airspace. This might be useful in order to display country borders etc.
- Coordinates are listed in the `[longitude, latitude]` format.
- The polygon is **closed** ‚Äî the first and last coordinate pairs should match.

Cross-Border areas (optional):
- If the area is located near FIR borders, and both parties require details of the same airspace, add the following line to the airspace properties:
- `"foreignClusters": ["efin"]` ‚Üí Helsinki FIR will also get the details of this airspace
- The areas may be added into the geojson of the other FIR either as `"name": ""` (not reservable) or with the same name as in the parent FIR (reservable in both FIRs)
- Currently only the FIR creating the reservation will receive the automatic TopSky activation
- Make sure the airspace name matches in both FIRs TopSky areas.txt

---

## üì¶ Add .json File (`xxxx.json`)

This file defines how the FIR is displayed in the app and how airspaces are grouped.

### ‚úÖ Example Structure

```json
{
  "mapCenter": [24.3, 58.5510],
  "mapZoom": 5.4,
  "pilotDocs": "https://wiki.vatsim-scandinavia.org/books/finnish-airports-charts/page/v-lara-airspace-reservation",
  "groups": {
    "GROUP1": {
      "airspaces": ["TSA1", "TSA2"],
      "lowerFL": 30,
      "upperFL": 999
    }
  }
}
```

### üîç JSON Field Descriptions

| Field        | Type               | Description                                                            |
|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mapCenter`  | `[number, number]` | Map center `[longitude, latitude]` for the default view                |
| `mapZoom`    | `number`           | Initial zoom level (e.g., `5.4`)                                       |
| (`pilotDocs`)  | `string`         | Optional URL to local procedures for Area Reservations                 |
| `groups`     | `object`           | A collection of airspace groups for organizing layers and filtering    |

Each entry in the `groups` object defines a preset selection of many airspace blocks. This makes it faster for the user to select commonly grouped airspace selections.

### üß± Group Object Structure

Each group includes:

| Field        | Type       | Description                                                  |
|--------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `airspaces`  | `string[]` | A list of airspace `name`s that belong to this group         |
| (`lowerFL`)  | `number`   | Optional Group Lower FL (e.g., `30`) - applies to all areas in group  |
| (`upperFL`)  | `number`   | Optional Group Upper FL (e.g., `999`) - applies to all areas in group |

Make sure that the `airspaces` name's matches with the names defined in the .geojson file.

**Example with multiple groups:**

```json
{
  "mapCenter": [24.3, 58.5510],
  "mapZoom": 6,
  "groups": {
    "TRIDENT": {
      "airspaces": ["TSA1", "TSA2"],
      "lowerFL": 0,
      "upperFL": 245
    },
    "POKKA": {
      "airspaces": ["TSA3", "TSA4", "TRA87W"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your FIR does not have grouped airspace reservations:

```json
{
  "mapCenter": [24.3, 58.5510],
  "mapZoom": 6,
  "groups": {
    "No Presets": {
      "airspaces": [""]
    }
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Validation Tips

Before submitting a Pull Request, ensure:

- [ ] Each airspace `Feature` in your `.geojson` has a unique `name` and the name matches with an airspace defined in TopSky areas.txt.
- [ ] All `name`s in your `.json` file‚Äôs `groups.airspaces` array **match exactly** with the `name` values in your `.geojson`
- [ ] Your `.geojson` file is valid [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) (you can use [geojson.io](https://geojson.io) or [geojsonlint.com](https://geojsonlint.com) to validate)
- [ ] Polygons in the `.geojson` are properly **closed** (i.e. the first and last coordinate pair are the same)
- [ ] Your `.json` file is valid JSON (no trailing commas, properly quoted strings, etc.)
- [ ] Flight levels (`lowerFL` and `upperFL`) are correct
- [ ] `mapCenter` and `mapZoom` are appropriate to display the full FIR area. You may login to V-LARA profile `EACCZAMC (test environment)` to view boundaries of different FIR's. The coordinates are shown in the top-right corner of the Map Display.

## üîó Connect with EuroScope TopSky plugin

After submitting and Approved Pull Request:
- Navigate to [lara-backend.lusep.fi/topsky/xxxx.txt](https://lara-backend.lusep.fi/topsky/lara.txt) (replace xxxx with your FIR code)
- The file shows all **currently ongoing** reservations. By default it includes a dummy reservation `VLARA:350101:350101:0:1000:1001:0:100:VLARA:`. This makes sure that TopSky is able to read the file at all times even when no reservations are present.
- Navigate to plugins/ `TopSkySettings.txt` and add the following details:
  - `HTTP_Areas_Remote_URL=https://lara-backend.lusep.fi/topsky/xxxx.txt`
  - `Areas_PreActiveTime=900` use at least 900s (15min)
- For automatic area loading, the `Airspace Management Window` shall be set to open automatically on startup
